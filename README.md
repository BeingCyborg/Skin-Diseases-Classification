# Skin Diseases Identification Dataset

This dataset contains a collection of medical images categorized into five distinct classes of skin conditions. The images can be used for training and evaluating machine learning models for skin disease classification. Each class represents a different skin condition, and the images are labeled accordingly. The dataset aims to provide a comprehensive set of labeled images to help researchers and practitioners develop algorithms for detecting various skin diseases, which are crucial for early diagnosis and treatment.

## Class Descriptions
1. **Normal**: Images of healthy, non-affected skin.
2. **Melanoma**: Images depicting melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer.
3. **Arsenic**: Skin lesions caused by arsenic exposure, a known risk factor for various skin diseases.
4. **Psoriasis**: Chronic autoimmune condition characterized by the rapid build-up of skin cells leading to scaling and inflammation.
5. **Eczema**: Also known as atopic dermatitis, characterized by itchy and inflamed skin.

## Dataset Composition
- **Normal**: 1815 images
- **Melanoma**: 1575 images
- **Arsenic**: 741 images
- **Psoriasis**: 1724 images
- **Eczema**: 1501 images

**Total number of images**: 7356

## Use Cases
This dataset is well-suited for the following use cases:
- **Classification**: Train models to classify skin conditions from images.
- **Computer Vision Tasks**: Can be used for segmentation, object detection, and other image analysis tasks.
- **Medical Research**: Develop AI models to aid dermatologists in diagnosing skin conditions.

## Dataset Characteristics
- **Image Format**: JPEG/PNG (based on the actual format of the dataset).
- **Size**: 3GB
- **Classes**: 5 (Normal, Melanoma, Arsenic, Psoriasis, Eczema)
